    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I'd <span class="never">never</span> seen a recipe for air fryer hearts of palm sticks but 
            I'd seen artichoke hearts and mozzarella sticks fried in the air fryer, so I thought...why not? What a pleasant surprise! 
            They take on the look of mozzarella sticks but have a tangy, meaty texture in the center. I serve them with marinara sauce for dipping, and ranch salad dressing would also be great.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can hearts of palm, drained</li>
            <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
                Beat egg with a fork in a separate shallow bowl. 
                Stir together Italian breadcrumbs, Panko breadcrumbs, and grated Parmesan in a third shallow bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Roll 1 heart of palm in seasoned flour, dip it in egg, then roll in seasoned bread crumbs.
                Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining hearts of palm.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the baking sheet to a freezer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray hearts of palm sticks with olive oil and place in the basket of the preheated air fryer. Cook for 6 minutes.
                Roll sticks over and cook until coating is crisp, about 6 minutes more. Serve immediately.
